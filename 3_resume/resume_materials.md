**Resume Materials**

### Resume Overview 


The goal of a resume is to show how you are uniquely qualified to solve a business’ current problems. 

The inverse is also true - The company does not want to make a bad hire. Bad hires are expensive in terms of dollars and opportunity costs, the biggest fear is the small chance of a very expensive lawsuit if they fire you.

**#1 Rule - K.I.S.S. Keep It Simple Silly**

Most resumes are quickly skimmed and discarded. Resumes are skimmed by humans or computers. Make it easy for your resume to be skimmed by both. 

Your resume should be aesthetically pleasing without being flashy. No one wants to see a creative resume.  There should be nothing visually distracting about your resume.  When in doubt, make it standard. 

Keep in mind the resume is **not** about you and the “correct” way the world should be. It is about your reader and the way the world actually is. Resumes must conform to the reader's expectations and the way hiring currently happens.

### Resume Guidelines 

Old people with old eyes read resumes. Resumes are typically skimmed in 10-20s (possibly as little as 3s). It should be very easy to skim your resume. It should have big clear blocks of text. White space should draw the reader's eyes to important points, such as your name and section headers. 

Your resume should echo the job posting. Talk about yourself in the same style as the company describes the position.

#### How to format your name 

*   Your name is the single most important element on your resume. Make it stand out.
*   The font should be slightly bigger than the rest.
*   Possibly bold.
*   Feel free to use a professional alias. In other words - if you are concerned that people will discriminate against you because of your official name, use a different one. For example, “D.J.” or “Abbie”.






#### Project Section 



*   Optional Section. The project section is medium-quality filler. For now, most people won't have enough to fill out a 1-page resume with data science related activities. If you have a 1-page resume with all data science stuff, then don't include a project section.
*   The highest value projects are individual, custom, novel, applied, domain-specific problems, potentially high-value business impact, end-to-end, contemporary.

    For example, "Fit a fine-tuned BERT (Transformer) model to predict the likelihood of churn based on a customer's Twitter feed."


    Lower value projects are the inverse - group, templated, rehash of common datasets, generic problems, academic research, only fit a model on precleaned data to incrementally improve established benchmarks, and uses outdated technologies.

*   The project section is a way to show that you can do the work of Data Science. The goal is to have the smallest delta possible between the daily work of a Data Scientist at the organization and your project. It derisks you as a candidate if you do not have a lot of relevant work experience. 
*   The point of projects is able to prove that you did work in a way that can be easily verified. If you choose to show off as a piece in your portfolio something that is commonly done and has existing tutorials out there already, it is very difficult for me as a hiring manager to evaluate whether you have actually done a bunch of work or whether you've simply followed along with a generic tutorial.
*   The best projects are individual projects that you created from scratch (e.g., did not use a template like Django) and not part of the MSDS program. Since it is individual and from scratch, the person looking at the project knows that you wrote all the code yourself. Having side-projects/passion projects shows you are able to identify things that need to be improved and you set out to improve them (without someone requiring you to do it).
*   If you put in a group project, I would be upfront about it because DS is a team sport. Be prepared to discuss what you individually contributed to the project.
*   I would advise against including “typical” class projects. Especially if they have templates or starter code. I
*   You can include the final projects from ML Lab or Intersession’s Distributed Systems. Even the Biz Comm project if it is relevant to the specific job you are applying for. They show your ability to do a complete project from end-to-end.
*   If you don’t have other projects, then include class-based projects.
*   The goal is to have 2-3 projects listed. There should **not** be 4+ projects. If you have that many projects, just include the 2-3 that are most relevant to the current position.
*   See about common pattern above how to template each bullet point


#### Hobbies / Activities Section 



*   The standard advice is: do not include a non-professional interest session. They generally do not help. Often they hurt.
*   If you choose to include it
    *   Make sure no one will be offended by the activities
    *   Add metrics (if appropriate) example - “Finished 4 50-mile endurance races last year.”
    *   The best items to add are competitive athletics. [Reference](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/20/the-surprising-thing-google-learned-about-its-employees-and-what-it-means-for-todays-students/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.56c78601dd02). 


#### Common errors



*   Do not abbreviate if it saves a single character.
    *   ~~Jun~~ June
*   As much as possible add links to live websites
    *   If you list a project about deploying code, there should be a hyperlink to a working website.
*   All urls should be full but without extra cruft
    *   Don't: ~~[GitHub](https://github.com/brianspiering)~~              
    *   Do: [github.com/brianspiering](https://github.com/brianspiering)
    *   Don't ~~[https://www.github.com/brianspiering](https://github.com/brianspiering)~~        
    *   Do: [github.com/brianspiering](https://github.com/brianspiering)
*   Inconsistent fonts - family and size



#### Miscellaneous tips



*   Use Google Voice number if you do not want your phone number out in the world.
*   Use only black text. People might print your resume out on black-ink-only printers. All the colored text might be missing!
*   When is the first time you mention Python? How far down the page? If it’s more ⅓ down the page then no one will read it.
*   Remember, unless you mention that you did this in Python, I’m going to assume that you did it in Excel.
*   Don’t randomly bold words/sentences. **It** is **very** distracting **and** slows **down** reading.
*   Be consistent with everything (font, layout, alignment, margins, date formatting).
*   Spacesmatter.Notincludingspacesmakesyourwritinghardtoread.
*   Add a line to visually separate sections. My favorite Unicode character for a line is  `Upper One Eight Block`: **▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔**



*   Writing Style
    *   Try to tell a story:
        *   Who are you now? 
        *   What makes you different?
        *    How does your past uniquely shape your present self (with a connection to this specific job)?
    *   Keep language and ideas simple. People read it quickly and are not experts in the domain and techniques.
    *   Nontechnical Audience 
        *   50% of the people that read your resume will be nontechnical. They should be able to understand the gist of every bullet point.
    *   Technical Audience
        *   All terms must be 100% accurate. If you use a term incorrectly, you will lose all credibility.
        *   Use common terms.
        *   Use high-level terms similar to what is in a job posting. You can say Machine Learning or Boosted Decision Trees. You do not have to say “XGBoost with L2 regularization”.
        *   Watch the choice of prepositions. You program “in Python”. You do not program “on Python”.
    *   Include an “and” for lists - first, second, and third thing’
    *   Use Oxford comma for lists - ‘first, second, and third thing’
    *   End each statement with a period. It is easier to read statements that end in periods. Even if the statement is not a complete sentence.
    *   Do not use semicolons; They are too fancy. Just use periods. Keep things short and punchy.
    *   Do not use complex clauses.
*   Keep tech terms up to date. I know FORTRAN but FORTRAN does not appear on my resume.
*   Add keywords specific to job postings. Copy and paste from the job posting. You didn’t need to include all of them. Use terms the same way the posting uses them. If they write Python, you write Python. If they write scikit-learn, you write scikit-learn.
*   Do not include GPA. No - You are more than a number. Don’t allow your rich education experience to be distilled into a single metric. And very few people outside of academia care about GPA. GPA has no absolute signal for job stuff, some programs are hard and other programs are easy.
*   Any algorithm you mention, you might be asked about. You should know how it works (even if you just called the package). Be able to answer the following questions:
    *   When should you use it?
    *   When should you not use it?
    *   How does the loss function work?
    *   If there is a decision boundary, you should be able to draw it?
    *   How do you interpret the results?
*   You should have multiple versions:
    *   "Traditional" Data Science version
    *   Deep Learning centric
    *   Business Analytics centric
    *   


### How to proofread for mistakes

*   Use 2 spell checkers. Grammarly is the best. Also, copy n’ paste into MS Word.
*   Read it out loud slowly.
*   Have Chrome read it out-loud.
*   Have a nontechnical friend read it out-loud.
*   Just because a word is not underlined in red does not mean it is correct.


#### Things to not include on a resume:  

                        

*   Resume should not include: Age, gender, marital status, photo, an objective statement or an offer to provide references.
*   Language, jargon, or acronyms that are unknown to employers; if you must use something peculiar you must define it.
*   No language or wording should be in any way negative about myself, co-workers, or employers.


#### List of terrible words that should never appear 


*   Utilize - too generic, passive voice. Be specific. Be active.
*   Various - a bucket for generic items. Be specific.
*   Etc - Either specify or drop.
*   Leveraging - replace with a more specific verb 


#### What if I can’t fit my resume on 1 page? 

I do not care how much you think you have done. I have done more, and I still only have a 1-page resume. 

You should prioritize items that demonstrate a track record of adding business value in a similar context. For example, I have worked at other MSDS programs in SF. That was the top item on my resume when I applied to work at USF. If you don't have specific items, then demonstrate your general data science abilities.

Thus, the hierarchy of elements to include (NOT THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY SHOULD APPEAR):



1. Previous relevant work experience
2. Independent projects (e.g., hackathons or volunteering)
3. Education
4. School projects (you can slip the skills into this section)
5. Skills Section (typically these contain no evidence)


#### What about gaps between items? 

You can represent yourself however you want. You can skip or reframe anything.

Try to avoid massive gaps in time.

The goal is to tell a story that is attractive to the hiring manager.

#### **What is the best way to write about my coursework on my resume?** 

A resume is not an official record of what you did. If the employee wants an official account then they will ask for your official transcripts. Should be brief, general, common, high-level descriptions, not the actual course titles.  A resume is a selected, highlight reel for your audience. You should never lie on a resume. You can "round up" or creatively massage your words.

You want to craft a resume that is the best version of you (from the viewpoint of an employer). 

The actual course titles that USF uses are often the mutant offspring of history and bureaucracy. Content and course titles are sometimes only loosely related. 

If I was a graduating student, I would include a coursework section that includes the string literals listed in the job posting: `Selected Coursework: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining, and Computer Science`

Specific to Data Science technical skills. No one cares that you took Business Communications or Sociology.

**Courses title to include**:

- "Machine Learning" - High demand skill. 

- "Deep Learning" - Everyone loves DL right now. Add it!

- "Distributed Computing (Spark)" - Everyone loves it also, and you added what it means!

- "Design of Experiments (A/B testing)" - Make it clear you are a money maker

- "SQL" - Table stakes for DS. If you want to be fancy, write “Relational Databases (SQL)”

- "Computer Science" - There is a common meme that DS can't program. Be explicit if you can make the bits dance.

- "Data Structures and Algorithms" - Specific CS course = Awesomeness

- "Time Series" / "Time Series Analysis" - This makes you unique among recent grads

- "Linear Regression"

- "Statistics"

- "Product Analytics" - Only for Data Analytics roles and if you have space

- "Data Visualization"

- “Data Ethics”

**Courses titles to avoid:**

- "Advanced Machine Learning": Machine Learning is great. "Advanced" is a generic adjective. You should be more specific.

- "Fundamentals in Deep Learning" /"Deep Learning Part 1":  Again avoid generic or uncommon adjectives. These ones are really not great because they imply you only know the basics.

- "EDA" or "Exploratory data analysis": Important but not highly valued when applying for jobs.

- "Feature Engineering": Important but not highly valued when applying for jobs. You can include it in the context of a project but not as a stand-alone skill.

- "Data Acquisition": Important but people won't know what that means.

- "Relational Databases" / RDMS: People will think that this means designing DBs. Most people in the program are not skilled at being a DBA. Once again either write “Relational Databases (SQL)” or just “SQL”

- "Distributed Data Systems" - sounds old, like some ITS course

- "Data Mining" - It is undefined and a bit “old-timey”. Avoid as a keyword unless in the job posting

- “Distributed Computing” This means you can build distributed systems (not just use distributed system). Almost everyone in the program can not do that.




#### Thoughts on File Types for Resumes and Cover Letters 

tl;dr - All submitted materials should be in both Microsoft Word and pdf. 

Submit in the format the companies ask for or people expect. People who work in hiring expect all documents to be in Word. Tech people expect pdf. There are risks to writing in LaTeX and rendering to pdf (namely, you can use character sets that are not machine-readable).

Keep The Goal The Goal - The goal is to make it as easy as possible for the employer to open your resume and cover letter to learn about your qualifications. The best advice is to submit materials in the format which the hiring manager explicitly asks for and keep the formatting as straightforward as possible.  All materials should be able to be submitted in multiple formats, primarily Microsoft Word and pdf.

If the posting does not specify and you are uploading your materials online, choose Word.

On the other hand, if you’re emailing a hiring manager directly and no preference was stated in the job posting, choose pdf. 

Recruiters (both internal and external) and recruiting software are expecting Word documents. A recruiter’s entire workflow is built around Word. They will copy n’ paste from your resume and cover letter into other things. They will also do things like “blinding”, redacting information. Their workflow is much harder in other document formats, including pdfs.

Almost all resumes and cover letters are electronically parsed with a parser called an Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). ATS are awful, brittle enterprise software.  They “read” your materials, parse them into standardized fields, and extract keywords. Recruiters and hiring managers often do not look directly at your materials. They look at the chopped-up version in an ATS. Your resume has to be standard in both filetype, formatting, and character choice. Recruiters and hiring managers are very busy. If any part of your application is blank, confusing, or random symbols, they will just ignore your application. 

ATS are designed to handle Word. Typically, they can handle pdf but not always. They can not handle anything different or creative. This includes formatting and characters. If your documents are creative (that includes images, columns, or tables) or include non-standard characters (for example the funny way LaTeX software writes the "LaTeX" word), those systems might not be able to parse it correctly or render it as random symbols. 

Thus, I **strongly** advise against writing your resume or cover letter in LaTeX and rendering it as pdf. There is a non-zero chance they could create a pdf that is not readable by every companies’ ATS. You’ll be rejected before any human sees your application, and you will not know that LaTeX is the reason. 

I know that Word is not the best document format in the world, there is LaTeX, pdf, Google Docs, markdown, or anything else. The people doing the hiring don’t care. It is their world, and they primarily use Word. It is best to do things in the way the world actually is right now. Do not make a stand, a statement, complain, or try to change the system.
