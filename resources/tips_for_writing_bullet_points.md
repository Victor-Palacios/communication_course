#### How to write a bullet point 

*   DO NOT PUT LISTS OF TECHNOLOGIES. Technologies should be either listed at the bottom or embedded within the project bullet. 
*   It is not a list of everything you did at the company. It is a highlight reel for an audience. What did you do? Why did it matter?
*   A Great Bullet Point Has 3 Parts:
    1. What? Answers the question “what happened?”
    2. How? Answering the questions “How did it happen? in what way? with what tools, methods, processes?”
    3. So What? Why do I care? What was the impact? How did this affect the business?
*   What / So What? what you achieved or what was the result. Why do I care? What was the impact? How did this affect the business?
*   How? How did it happen? In what way? with what tools, methods, processes?
*   “Items on the resume are mostly method/process focused (I did something with XYZ technology on ABC data), many practicum projects do have an impact on the organization (I can tell this only after listening to their explanation), and IMO the impact and results from your model it's the most valuable things you can put on the resume (try something like "The model increases X business metrics by Y% or Z amount. The model is trained on XX million rows with A/B/C approaches and outperforms the current approach by XX%, expected to save $XX money/drive XX% growth in traffic once in production). Don't be shy on your resume”
*   Start with specific, active, past tense verbs. Do not use “utilize”. 
*   Start with the goal. What is the business objective you accomplished?
*   Focus on business-level outcomes. Answer - “Why does this matter?”
*   Include evidence/proof of expertise
    *   This is another version of  “Show, Don't tell”.
    *   Minimize adjectives. Use metrics instead. 
        *   Adjectives are opinions. People’s opinions defer.
        *   Metrics (relative and absolute) are much better. 
            1. “Increased accuracy by 10% and reduced latency by 100%” are 
        *   Adjectives are okay to add if they help with being specific and clarification: “early-stage startup”, “FinTech startup”
    *   There should be no adverbs, especially filler ones:
        *    "mostly" is a banned word on resumes
*   Common pattern
    *   Focus on the “why”. What is the outcome or goal of the project? Keep the “how” high level.
    *   &lt;specific active verb> &lt;why / reason> &lt;what you did / the technical part> &lt;business-level result> &lt;evidence with metrics>
    *   “Fit Boosted Decision Trees to predict customer churn. Identified top 3 features which were used by the Marketing team to reduce churn by 25% YoY”
    *   “Predicted binary classification with Random Forest with 94% accuracy.”
    *   “Predicted parking tickets rates with Deep Learning. Achieved 95% accuracy. Top 1% model on Kaggle. [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/brianspiering/smart-cards).” 
    *   Good prompts:
        *   "Increased model performance through …"
        *   “Automated data cleaning with Python scripts.” 
        *   “Performed automated feature selection with regularized regression.”
        *   “Used Apache Spark’s MLib to model 5 GB of data. Found …”
        *   “Clustered customer churn data with k-means and DBSCAN to find….”
    *   You might not have outcomes/evidence/metrics. That is okay. It is just better if you can include them.
    *   Use the phrase “work in progress” if you don’t have outcomes for current projects.
    *   Avoid too much detail about ML methods
        *   “Fit regularized linear regression” is fine
        *   “Fit linear regression with L1 regularization on 125 independent variables” is too granular.
    *   Start broad with techniques and then funnel down.
        *   "Discovered consumer’s opinions through NLP techniques (parsed dependency trees)"
    *    `Incorporated`, `Carried out`, and `Assisted` are all weak verbs. Use stronger verbs like `Built` ‘Created’ or ‘Lead’.
    *   If you are currently working on a something, you can use the present tense - “Currently building a model to predict” or “Working on a price prediction algorithms and customer behavior analytics to”
*   Always define acronyms
    *   Especially Data Science / Machine Learning jargon
    *   This also includes domain-specific acronyms
    *   Deep Learning (DL), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), ….
    *   [Common business acronyms](https://www.themuse.com/advice/your-ultimate-cheat-sheet-to-deciphering-the-123-most-common-business-acronyms) are an exception. They do not need to be defined
    *   Do not abbreviate if it saves you a single character.
*   Remove clichés (e.g.“actionable insights”, “fast learner”)
*   Remove non-data-science related jobs.
    *   No one cares that you were a Food Service Superstar
    *   If there is extra room, you can include quantitatively-oriented or professional-level positions
        *   Examples: Post-bachelor Research Assistant or Accountant or Manager or CEO
*   The same concepts apply to describing your Practicum experience. Distill your experience to the simple, best story and talking points for future employers.
- Add oxford comma to all lists. It is the comma right before the "and": apples, oranges, and bannanas.
- All bullet points should end in period. It makes separate points easier to parse.
- If one of our experiences was just for a few months, do we still have to have the bullet points?
    - LinkedIn and your resume is a chance to tell your story / display your personal brand. I would include a brief description of each item. It might make sense to you but someone else reading it might not have context. A single sentence is fine.
