======

*   Overall Formatting
    *   Sections are required (unless marked as optional) in this order:
        1. Header - always first
        1. Summary
        2. Education - always before work experience for students
        3. Work Experience
        4. Projects (optional)
        4. Skills - **ALWAYS LAST**
        5. No non-standard sections
    *   File type is Google Doc. Later to be exported as MS Word or pdf. See section "thoughts on file formats" in Resume Materials.
    *   The filename is formated like - FirstName_LastName_Resume
        *   Example: Brian_Spiering_Resume
        *   Anti-Example: finalresumev4
    *   One page only
    *   Human-readable
        *   10-15% white space.
        *   Properly formatted numbers:
            *   Big numbers have commas: 6,000 or 15,000 or abbreviated 500K-1 MM means "500,000-1,000,000".
            *   Be appropriately precise, no decimals or at most 2 decimals.
            *   Do not use scientific notation. 
    *   Machine-readable
        *   No columns, tables, boxes, math symbols, Greek symbols, or mathematical notation
        *   No unusual bullets: ✥ ⚜★ ✯ ❆ ❀ ☭ 
        *   Common accented characters are okay: é â î ô ñ ü ï ç, …
        *   Punctuation symbols are okay: & | ~ • - — ●, …
        *   ALIGNMENT SHOULD BE STANDARD ACROSS SECTIONS.
    *   No colored text.
    *   Font 
        *   Standard Type (i.e., Times New Roman, Arial, Cambria, or Helvetica)

    *   Phone

            *   Use full email `[studentid@dons.usfca.edu](mailto:student@dons.usfca.edu)`. Emails have bounced without `dons` suffix.  Anti-example - `[studentid@usfca.edu](mailto:student@dons.usfca.edu)`
            *   Do **not** include any dots `.` They don’t matter to Gmail, read more [here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7436150?hl=en), but resume parsers might. If the regex for the resume parser is incorrectly coded, you won’t get any responses.
