You are welcome to borrow elements and ideas from other people's resumes. In business, that is best practices (not plagiarism).

Order operations for reviewing:

1. Follow checklist / guides / samples.
2. Get a peer to review.

4. Have Brian review.

    I'm happy to review your resume. However, my limited time is best spent given nuanced, personalized feedback (not making sure you conform to a checklist). If you want to me to review, please Slack me your resume as a Google Doc in your Google Drive and the names of your two peer reviewers. If I see you have not followed the checklist, I'll immediately stop reviewing and request that you follow the checklist. If there are pronounced deviations from the checklist, I'll hold you and the peer reviewer accountable (aka, take off professionalism points from everyone).
